# Image-Blending

Pasting Function Explanation
Pasting is a straightforward application of the copying. It is accomplished by using the Bergman image as the source and the Bogart image as the target. It simply requires looping over the pixels of the source and using their RGB values as replacement values for the corresponding pixel in the target. (Of course the target image should be larger than the source.)
